# Library Management System

Full-stack web application using React, Go, and PostgreSQL to help librarians manage a comprehensive database of clients, books, and payment information. The platform also allows clients to check out books, pay late fees, and update their personal details through an intuitive user interface.

I utilized PostgreSQL for relational database management, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of records. On the backend, I implemented a Go server to handle API requests, facilitating smooth communication between the database and the frontend.

This project provided valuable experience in building scalable, database-driven web applications, showcasing my ability to create end-to-end solutions that enhance both administrative workflows and user experiences.
